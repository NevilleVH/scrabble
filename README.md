# scrabble
A command line interface for playing Scrabble.
Features an "AI" and pretty Unicode box characters (as a result; compile with "javac -encoding UTF8 PlaceHolder.java").
I plan to implement p2p multiplayer functionality at some point - still deciding whether to unspagettify everything first. Also in the to-do list are a GUI and perhaps a database for the word list.
